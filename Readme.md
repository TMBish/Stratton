# Overview

Stratton 

## Use

Visit stratton at my website - hosted here.

If you want to play around with it on your local machine use shiny's sweet rungithub function:

```R
runGithub("TMBish/Stratton")
```

## Issues & Improvements

* The movie timeline tab
* Redirect financial scraping to a more robust and complete data source
	+ Box office mojo currently
	+ Crap URL system and movie coverage leading to lots of missing data
	+ Re-rote for imdb (in the variants sub-folder) but it was too slow 
* Add error region for LOESS regression - looks nicer that way
* Add functionality to dynamically label clusters a la 538
