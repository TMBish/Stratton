	The inspiration for this application originally came from 
	<a href = 'https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-four-types-of-tom-cruise-movies/'> this 538 article, </a>
	which I thought was kinda cool. The centrepiece of which was this chart, which groups 
	Tom Cruise movies together using the dimensions of quality and profitibality:

	While approximately 75% of the way through developing Stratton I realised I had previously seen, but had 
	forgotten about, an alarmingly similar application in 2 places 
	<a href = 'https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html'> here </a> and
	<a href = 'https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/tree/master/examples/app/movies'> here </a>...lol.

	<br><br>

	Anyway, mine's not exactly the same. It also hopefully showcases some of
	the features of Shiny and growing ecosystem of satellite packages that
	enables the creation of a web-app like this in under <strong> 1,000 lines of code </strong>.
